# Ixion Modding Helper
[Nexusmods](https://www.nexusmods.com/ixion/mods/11)  
<br>
This is a modding helper I wrote for myself (and of course others) to make modding easier. Features for now include:
- A settings helper with its own settings page including:
  - Key input setting
  - Boolean setting  
Which are automatically saved
- A game state helper
- A button helper
- A popup helper

I won't provide any documentation (at least not for now). If you want to know how it works/use it, just ask on discord.

# Installation
You only need to install this mod, if its required by another mod.
Download and put the latest release into the plugins ("\IXION\BepInEx\plugins\") folder.

# How to use
The mods settings page added by this mod can be found, both in the main menu **and** in game, inside the games settings menu (duh).  
You can use it the same as any other settings tab from the game.

# Issues and Questions
If you find any bugs please report them in the issues tab and for any questions simply ask in the [DOLOS A.E.C.](https://discord.gg/UMtuJrSmY3) modding channel (with ping pls) or message me directly (@captnced).
