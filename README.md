# Ixion Modding Helper
[Nexusmods](https://www.nexusmods.com/ixion/mods/11)  
<br>
This is a modding helper I wrote for myself (and of course others) to make modding easier. Features include:
- A settings helper with its own settings page including:
  - Key input setting
  - Boolean setting
  - Slider setting
  - Number input setting  
Which are automatically saved
- A mod menu
- A game state helper
- A button helper
- A popup helper
- A key listener helper

I won't provide any documentation (at least not for now). If you want to know how it works/use it, just ask on discord.

# Installation
You only need to install this mod, if its required by another mod, though I recommend it for any of my mods.
Download and put the latest release into the plugins ("\IXION\BepInEx\plugins\") folder.

# How to use
The mods settings page added by this mod can be found, both in the main menu **and** in game, inside the games settings menu (duh).  
You can use it the same as any other settings tab from the game.
The mod menu is accessible from the mods button in the main menu, though not in-game.

# Issues and Questions
If you find any bugs please report them in the issues tab and for any questions simply ask in the [DOLOS A.E.C.](https://discord.gg/UMtuJrSmY3) modding channel (with ping pls) or message me directly (@captnced).
